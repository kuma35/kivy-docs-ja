"Each widget has a canvas, i.e. a place to draw on. The canvas is a group "
"of drawing instructions that should be executed whenever there is a "
"change to the widget's graphical representation."

"You can add two types of instructions to the canvas: *context* "
"instructions and *vertex* instructions. You can add instructions either "
"from Python code or from the kv file (the preferred way). If you add them"
" via the kv file, the advantage is that they are automatically updated "
"when any property they depend on changes. In Python, you need to do this "
"yourself."
