"|Layout| is a special kind of widget that controls the size and position "

"**BoxLayout**: Arranges widgets in an adjacent manner (either vertically "

"**FloatLayout**: Allows placing children with arbitrary locations and "

"(1, 1) will make every child the same size as the whole layout, so you "
"probably want to change this value if you have more than one child. You "
