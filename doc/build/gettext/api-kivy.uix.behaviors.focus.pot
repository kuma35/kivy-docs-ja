msgid "The :class:`~kivy.uix.behaviors.FocusBehavior` `mixin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin>`_ class provides keyboard focus behavior. When combined with other FocusBehavior widgets it allows one to cycle focus among them by pressing tab. In addition, upon gaining focus, the instance will automatically receive keyboard input."

msgid "Focus, very different from selection, is intimately tied with the keyboard; each keyboard can focus on zero or one widgets, and each widget can only have the focus of one keyboard. However, multiple keyboards can focus simultaneously on different widgets. When escape is hit, the widget having the focus of that keyboard will de-focus."

msgid "In essence, focus is implemented as a doubly linked list, where each node holds a (weak) reference to the instance before it and after it, as visualized when cycling through the nodes using tab (forward) or shift+tab (backward). If a previous or next widget is not specified, :attr:`focus_next` and :attr:`focus_previous` defaults to `None`. This means that the :attr:`~kivy.uix.widget.Widget.children` list and :attr:`parents <kivy.uix.widget.Widget.parent>` are walked to find the next focusable widget, unless :attr:`focus_next` or :attr:`focus_previous` is set to the `StopIteration` class, in which case focus stops there."
