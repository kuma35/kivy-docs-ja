msgid "Some of them are licensed in a way that requires including a copyright notice somewhere in your app (or more). Before distributing any of the binaries, please **check all the created files** that don't belong to your source (.dll, .pyd, .so, ...) and include the appropriate copyright notices if required by the license the files belong to. This way you may satisfy licensing requirements of the Kivy deps."

If you care about your users, you might want to slow down a little and read more about the |cons|_."
