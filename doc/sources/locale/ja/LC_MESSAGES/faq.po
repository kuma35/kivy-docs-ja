"Python is a very agile language that allows you to do many things in a "
"(by comparison) short time. For many development scenarios, we strongly "
"prefer writing our application quickly in a high-level language such as "
"Python, testing it, then optionally optimizing it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:123
msgid ""
"But what about speed? If you compare execution speeds of implementations "
"for a certain set of algorithms (esp. number crunching) you will find "
"that Python is a lot slower than say, C++. Now you may be even more "
"convinced that it's not a good idea in our case to use Python. Drawing "
"sophisticated graphics (and we are not talking about your grandmother's "
"OpenGL here) is computationally quite expensive and given that we often "
"want to do that for rich user experiences, that would be a fair argument."
" **But**, in virtually every case your application ends up spending most "
"of the time (by far) executing the same part of the code. In Kivy, for "
"example, these parts are event dispatching and graphics drawing. Now "
"Python allows you to do something to make these parts much faster."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:138
msgid ""
"By using Cython, you can compile your code down to the C level, and from "
"there your usual C compiler optimizes things. This is a pretty pain free "
"process and if you add some hints to your code, the result becomes even "
"faster. We are talking about a speed up in performance by a factor of "
"anything between 1x and up to more than 1000x (greatly depends on your "
"code). In Kivy, we did this for you and implemented the portions of our "
"code, where efficiency really is critical, on the C level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:147
msgid ""
"For graphics drawing, we also leverage today's GPUs which are, for some "
"tasks such as graphics rasterization, much more efficient than a CPU. "
"Kivy does as much as is reasonable on the GPU to maximize performance. If"
" you use our Canvas API to do the drawing, there is even a compiler that "
"we invented which optimizes your drawing code automatically. If you keep "
"your drawing mostly on the GPU, much of your program's execution speed is"
" not determined by the programming language used, but by the graphics "
"hardware you throw at it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:157
msgid ""
"We believe that these (and other) optimizations that Kivy does for you "
"already make most applications fast enough by far. Often you will even "
"want to limit the speed of the application in order not to waste "
"resources. But even if this is not sufficient, you still have the option "
"of using Cython for your own code to *greatly* speed it up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:164

"Trust us when we say that we have given this very careful thought. We "
"have performed many different benchmarks and come up with some clever "
"optimizations to make your application run smoothly."

msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:183
msgid ""
"Our developers are professionals and are pretty savvy in their area of "
"expertise. However, before Kivy came around there was (and still is) a "
"project named PyMT that was led by our core developers. We learned a "
"great deal from that project during the time that we developed it. In the"
" more than two years of research and development we found many "
"interesting ways to improve the design of our framework. We have "
"performed numerous benchmarks and as it turns out, to achieve the great "
"speed and flexibility that Kivy has, we had to rewrite quite a big "
"portion of the codebase, making this a backwards-incompatible but future-"
"proof decision. Most notable are the performance increases, which are "
"just incredible. Kivy starts and operates just so much faster, due to "
"these heavy optimizations. We also had the opportunity to work with "
"businesses and associations using PyMT. We were able to test our product "
"on a large diversity of setups and made PyMT work on all of them. Writing"
" a system such as Kivy or PyMT is one thing. Making it work under all "
"these different conditions is another. We have a good background here, "
"and brought our knowledge to Kivy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:203
msgid ""
"Furthermore, since some of our core developers decided to drop their "
"full-time jobs and turn to this project completely, it was decided that a"
" more professional foundation had to be laid. Kivy is that foundation. It"
" is supposed to be a stable and professional product. Technically, Kivy "
"is not really a successor to PyMT because there is no easy migration path"
" between them. However, the goal is the same: Producing high-quality "
"applications for novel user interfaces. This is why we encourage everyone"
" to base new projects on Kivy instead of PyMT. Active development of PyMT"
" has stalled. Maintenance patches are still accepted."

"Yes, we love patches. In order to ensure a smooth integration of your "
"precious changes however, please make sure to read our contribution "
"guidelines. Obviously we don't accept every patch. Your patch has to be "
"consistent with our styleguide and, more importantly, make sense. It does"
