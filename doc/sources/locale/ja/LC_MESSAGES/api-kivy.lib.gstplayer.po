"`GstPlayer` is a media player implemented specifically for Kivy with "
"Gstreamer 1.0. It doesn't use Gi at all and is focused on what we want: "
"the ability to read video and stream the image in a callback, or read an "
"audio file. Don't use it directly but use our Core providers instead."

"This player is automatically compiled if you have `pkg-config --libs "

"This is an external library and Kivy does not provide any support for it."
