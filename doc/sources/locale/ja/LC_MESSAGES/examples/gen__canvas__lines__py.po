"This demonstrates the experimental and unfinished SmoothLine feature for "
"fast line drawing. You should see a multi-segment path at the top of the "
"screen, and sliders and buttons along the bottom. You can click to add "
"new points to the segment, change the transparency and width of the line,"
" or hit 'Animate' to see a set of sine and cosine animations. The Cap and"
" Joint buttons don't work: SmoothLine has not implemented these features "
"yet."
