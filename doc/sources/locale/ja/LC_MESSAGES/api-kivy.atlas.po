"Atlas manages texture atlases: packing multiple textures into one. With "
"it, you reduce the number of images loaded and speedup the application "
"loading. This module contains both the Atlas class and command line "

"command line section requires the Pillow library, or the defunct Python "
"Imaging Library (PIL), to be installed."
