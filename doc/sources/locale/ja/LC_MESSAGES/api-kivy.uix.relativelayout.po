"Although there are other coordinate systems defined, e.g. local and "
"parent coordinates, these coordinate systems are identical to the window "
"coordinate system as long as a relative layout type widget is not in the "
"widget's parent stack. When widget.pos is read or a touch is received, "
"the coordinate values are in parent coordinates. But as mentioned, these "
"are identical to window coordinates, even in complex widget stacks as "
