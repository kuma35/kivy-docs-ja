msgid "Unlike the default twisted reactor, the installed reactor will not handle any signals unless you set the 'installSignalHandlers' keyword argument to 1 explicitly.  This is done to allow kivy to handle the signals as usual, unless you specifically want the twisted reactor to handle the signals (e.g. SIGINT)."

msgid "The kivy examples include a small example of a twisted server and client. The server app has a simple twisted server running and logs any messages. The client app can send messages to the server and will print its message and the response it got. The examples are based mostly on the simple Echo example from the twisted docs, which you can find here:"
