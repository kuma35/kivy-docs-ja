"This example changes texture properties and the properties of its "
"containing rectangle. You should see some a multicolored texture with "
"sliders to the left and below and buttons at the bottom of the screen. "
"The image :ref:`texture_example_image.png "
"<canvas_texture_example_image.png>` is rendered into the rectangle. "
"Sliders change the number of copies of the texture (the tex_coords), the "
"size of enclosing rectangle (the taw_height and taw_width) while the "
"buttons change how the texture is rendered when more than one copy is in "
"the rectangle (the texture_wrap)."
