"The Kivy Catalog viewer showcases widgets available in Kivy and allows "
"interactive editing of kivy language code to get immediate feedback. You "
"should see a two panel screen with a menu spinner button (starting with "
"'Welcome') and other controls across the top.The left pane contains kivy "
"(.kv) code, and the right side is that code rendered. You can edit the "
"left pane, though changes will be lost when you use the menu spinner "
"button. The catalog will show you dozens of .kv examples controlling "
"different widgets and layouts."

"option are set in containers_kvs directory. To add a new .kv file to the "
"Kivy Catalog, add a .kv file into the container_kvs directory and "
"reference that file in the ScreenManager section of kivycatalog.kv."
